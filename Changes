Revision history for Perl module Dumbbench

	* Outlier rejection claimed to be disabled when setting the
          threshold to 0. But in reality it defaulted. Now, the claim
          is true and setting the threshold to 0 "sigmas" will disable
          outlier rejection.
	* Improved tests for outlier rejection.

0.09  2013-12-30
	* Fix for infinite loops (David Golden)
	* Benchmarks can be taken from modules (brian d foy)
	* Option to output R-compatible data table (brian d foy)
	* Example R script for making box plots from table data (brian d foy)
	* --pin-frequency option on Linux to pin CPU frequency for
	  more consistent benchmark results.
	  (Warning: Use this option at your own risk.)

0.08 - 2012-07-03
	* POD fix (Eduardo Ariño de la Rubia)

0.07 - 2012-01-15

	* Now using the shell for testing external commands where necessary.
	* Much faster stats due to using Statistics::CaseResampling.
	* Some changes to the simulation code.

0.04 - 2010-09-21
	* Various small but important bug fixes.
	* Now comes with Benchmark::Dumb, an almost-Benchmark-compatible
	  interface.
	* Requires newer Number::WithError (1.00).
	* Outlier-filtering now a feature of the statistics package.
	* Ships with a toy-MC for simulating timing distributions.
	* Outlier rejection now at three sigma instead of 2.5.
	* Option to disable subtraction of dry-run timing.
	* Iterative re-running now re-runs a fraction of the previous runs
	  to avoid frequent sorting overhead. (geometric progression)
